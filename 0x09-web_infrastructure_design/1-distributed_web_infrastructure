* The second server is added so that more traffic can be diverted to the supporting server to prevent the first one from crashing from excess traffic.

* The load balancer is added to transfer excess traffic between the two servers.

* The load balancing algorithm works by checking which server has the smallest traffic and sends incoming traffic there. 

* The active/active server clustering is different from the active/passive one as the two servers will actively work together to control traffic, while in the active/passive one of the servers will wait, to handle any redundancy from the first server.
